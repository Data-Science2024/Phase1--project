## Project Description
    This project aims to support Microsoft in launching its presence in the movie industry by creating a new movie studio. Microsoft lacks crucial insights into successful film genres that generate significant box office revenue and garner positive audience reception. The objective is to conduct a thorough analysis of movie data to provide actionable insights that will enable Microsoft to make informed decisions about the genres of films they should focus on producing.
